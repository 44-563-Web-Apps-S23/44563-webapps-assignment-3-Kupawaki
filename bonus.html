        <h1><b><i>Khaki Yeti Crab-Man</i></b></h1>
        <p>Khaki Yeti Crab-Man is nothing more than a common Yeti Crab, which you have surely heard of, 
            except that this specific yeti crab happens to have super powers. His powers are a result
            of him being born and raised in a thermal vent at the very bottom of the ocean.</p>

        <h5>Khaki Yeti Crab-Man's powers include, but are not limited to:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to walk in a straight line, for a very long time</li>
            <li>The abiity to live for an extended period in water <i>and</i> on land</li>
            <li>The ability to turn ingested organic matter into energy which can be used at a later time</li>
        </ul>
